    <p>The Space Stone or the Tesseract was first seen in Captan America The First Avenger. Where a evil organization HYDRA used the Tesseract to power their weapons in, but Captain America crashed a plane containing the Tesseract at the end of that movie. The stone made reapperents when loki comes down to earth amd steals it to make a portal. When the Red Skull holds it in his bare hand, he describes the Stone â€œcasting him outâ€, as it creates a wromhole dragging him to a black hole, this also implies it has other powers. Erik Selvig is able to manipulate it to form a worm hole allowing the Chitauri to invade. Thor then uses it to teleport him and Loki back to Asgard. In Infinity War, Thanos smashes its cubic container and uses it primarily for teleporting vast distances. However he also uses it for creating gravitational fields to stop Lokiâ€™ assassination attempt. On Titan he uses it to grab chunks of Titanâ€™s moon and hurl them as meteorites (along with usage of other stones). In The Snap, itâ€™s used to affect beings all across Space.</p>
